# Knight and Robot Game

## Description

This is a simple interactive game created using the Codesters library, where a knight and a robot can be controlled to perform various actions in a castle-themed environment.

## How It Works

The game involves the following key elements:

- The knight and robot sprites are placed on the stage with specific initial positions and sizes.
- The knight can be moved using arrow keys (right, left, up, down).
- The robot can be controlled using 'a', 'd', 'w', 's' keys for left, right, up, and down movements, respectively.
- If the knight collides with a blue object, it removes the object and says "OW!".
- Pressing the space bar triggers the robot to shoot a blue laser in the left direction.

## Notes

- Make sure to have the Codesters library installed (`pip install codesters`) before running the code.
- Explore and modify the code to create your own variations and features in the game.
