# Space Shooter

## Description

Embark on an exciting space adventure in this interactive game created using the Codesters library. Pilot a spaceship through the cosmic expanse, dodging obstacles, shooting lasers, and managing your lives to stay in the game.

## How It Works

The game features:

- The background is set to a space-themed environment.
- Walls are disabled, providing free movement in the vastness of space.
- Two spaceships, one controlled by the player (green) and the other by the computer (blue), are present.
- Spaceship images are loaded from URLs, creating visually appealing game characters.
- Lives for each spaceship (player and computer) are displayed on the screen.
- Controls:
  - Player's spaceship (Green): Up and down arrow keys to move, space bar to shoot lasers.
  - Computer's spaceship (Blue): 'W' and 'S' keys to move, 'E' key to shoot lasers.
- Laser colors distinguish between player (green) and computer (blue) shots.
- Collisions with lasers reduce lives for the respective spaceships, updating the display.
- The game ends when either the player or computer runs out of lives.

## Notes
