# On The Fritz

## Description

Embark on a cyber-themed adventure with this interactive game created using the Codesters library. Navigate a robot through the cyber world, collect treasures, and avoid obstacles to increase your score while managing your limited lives.

## How It Works

The game features:

- The background is set to a futuristic cyber blue environment.
- Walls are disabled, allowing free movement within the cyber space.
- A robot sprite is controlled using right and left arrow keys for smooth navigation.
- The game starts with 25 lives and a score of 0, displayed on the screen.
- Treasures (treasure chests) and obstacles (water bottles) are dynamically generated at random positions.
- Colliding with a water bottle reduces lives, updating the display accordingly.
- Colliding with a treasure chest increases the score, updating the display accordingly.
- The game continues in a loop until lives run out.

## Notes

- Ensure the Codesters library is installed (`pip install codesters`) before running the code.
- Use the right and left arrow keys to control the robot.
- Collect treasure chests to increase your score and avoid water bottles to preserve lives.
- Customize the game by modifying the code to add new features or change existing elements.
