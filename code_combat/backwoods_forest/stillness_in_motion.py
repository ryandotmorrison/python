# You can put one if-statement within another if-statement.
# Be careful how the if statements interact with each other.
# Make sure the indentation is correct!
# It's helpful to start with one outer if/else,
# using comments as placeholders for the inner if/else:

while True:
    enemy = hero.findNearestEnemy()
    # If there is an enemy, then...
    if enemy:
        # Create a distance variable with distanceTo.
        distance = hero.distanceTo(enemy)
        # If the distance is less than 5 meters, then attack.
        if distance < 5:
            hero.attack(enemy)
        # Else (the enemy is far away), then shield.
        else:
            hero.shield()
        pass
    # Else (there is no enemy)...
    else:
        # ... then move back to the X.
        hero.moveXY(40, 34)
